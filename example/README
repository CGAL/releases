This is the README file for compiling applications which makes use of CGAL



If you are not expected to compile in this directory you should copy
the entire directory Cgal/example to your home drectory. Do NOT copy
the library itself, that is the header or source files. Do NOT copy
the compiler and architecture specific files that are included by the
makefile. Not only that it takes space on disks, you will sooner or
later end up with an outdated local copy.


You have to modify four things in the makefile in this directory.
This makefile is generic for any application making use of CGAL

(1) The compiler, either g++ (GNU), or CC (SUN, Silicon Graphics).

(2) The directory where LEDA is installed at your site.

(3) The directory where CGAL is installed at your site.

(4) The operating system of the machine where you are compiling.


That should be it. Type `make program' and cross your fingers.

If you build the program for several compilers in a row,
you have to force the compiler to recompile the source. 
Type `gmake touch' followed by `gmake program'.
