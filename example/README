This is the README file for compiling an application which makes use of CGAL

You have to modify three things in the makefile in this directory.
This makefile is generic for any application making use of CGAL

(1) The compiler, either g++ (GNU), or CC (SUN, Silicon Graphics).

(2) The directory where LEDA is installed at your site.

(3) The directory where CGAL is installed at your site.



That should be it. Type `gmake program' and cross your fingers.

If you build the program for several compilers in a row,
you have to force the compiler to recompile the source. 
Type `gmake touch' followed by `gmake program'.
