This is the README file for compiling applications which makes use of CGAL.

File program.C is a first example of how CGAL code looks like. Don't
be dissappointed that nothing spectacular happens when you execute it.

In this directory you see files with the extension '.fw'. These are
funnelweb files, that is files which contain code and documentation in
LaTeX. As it is `all-in-one-file' you need a tool to separate them.
We separated them for you, so that there is no need to ftp this tool for
the moment.  You find PostScript versions of the LaTeX'ed documents in
the directory Cgal/doc.

funnelweb.fw should give you a rough idea what you can do with funnelweb.
support-library.fw  shows you how to get graphical IO with CGAL.

You should compile the file io2window.C to see how it works.



If you are not expected to compile in this directory you should copy
the entire directory Cgal/example to your own directory. Do NOT copy
the library itself, that is the header or source files. Do NOT copy
the compiler and architecture specific files that are included by the
makefile. Not only that it takes space on disks, you will sooner or
later end up with an outdated local copy.


You have to modify four things in the makefile in this directory.
This makefile is generic for any application making use of CGAL

(1) The compiler, either g++ (GNU), or CC (SUN, Silicon Graphics).

(2) The directory where LEDA is installed at your site.

(3) The directory where CGAL is installed at your site.

(4) The operating system of the machine where you are compiling.


That should be it. Type `make program' and cross your fingers.

If you build the program for several compilers in a row,
you have to force the compiler to recompile the source. 
Type `make touch' followed by `make program'.
