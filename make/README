This directory contains a file with directory information (CGAL_directories) and
a number of files with platform dependent information (makefile_<os>_<compiler>).
The files with extension _L and _LEDA should be used if you use CGAL and LEDA
simultaneously, where with the latter the LEDA memory management is used in CGAL
as well. The former uses bools from LEDA, but not the memory management.
