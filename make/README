This directory contains the following files:

CGAL_directories         : a file with the location of the CGAL lib and include directory

makefile_<os>_<compiler> : include files with platform dependent makefile settings (these
                           files will be generated during installation)
                           <os> and <compiler> are abbreviations of the operating system
                           and the compiler for which the include file is intended

                           if you choose LEDA support, the include file gets the
                           extension _LEDA

sample_makefile
sample_makefile_LEDA     : two examples of the include files that will be generated
                           during installation of CGAL
