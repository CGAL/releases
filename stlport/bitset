#ifndef __SGI_STL_BITSET
#define __SGI_STL_BITSET

// This implementation of bitset<> has a second template parameter,
// _WordT, which defaults to unsigned long.  *YOU SHOULD NOT USE
// THIS FEATURE*.  It is experimental, and it may be removed in
// future releases.

// A bitset of size N, using words of type _WordT, will have 
// N % (sizeof(_WordT) * CHAR_BIT) unused bits.  (They are the high-
// order bits in the highest word.)  It is a class invariant
// of class bitset<> that those unused bits are always zero.

// Most of the actual code isn't contained in bitset<> itself, but in the 
// base class _Base_bitset.  The base class works with whole words, not with
// individual bits.  This allows us to specialize _Base_bitset for the
// important special case where the bitset is only a single word.

// The C++ standard does not define the precise semantics of operator[].
// In this implementation the const version of operator[] is equivalent
// to test(), except that it does no range checking.  The non-const version
// returns a reference to a bit, again without doing any range checking.
