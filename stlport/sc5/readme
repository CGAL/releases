PURPOSE OF THIS DIRECTORY:

To accomodate naming conversion for SunPro C++ 5.0 compiler (.SUNWCCh)

These wrappers are not put into STLport main include directory because :

1) These files are symbolic links and may clobber principal headers with some systems/archive tools.
2) These headers are beyond the scope of C++ standard.

If you use this STLport installation only for SUNPro, I would suggest you to link .SUNWCCh and .h files
in this directory symbolically into the main STLport include directory (..).

-Boris.
