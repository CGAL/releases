<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>

CGAL, the <EM>Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</EM>, is written in
C++ and consists of three parts.
The first part is the kernel, which consists of constant size non-modifiable
geometric primitive objects and operations on these objects.
The objects are parameterized by a representation class, which specifies
the coordinate representation and the underlying number types used for
calculations.
The second part is a collection of basic geometric data structures and
algorithms, which are parameterized by traits classes that define the
interface between the data structure or algorithm, and the primitives they use.
The third part consists of non-geometric support facilities, such as
`circulators', random sources, I/O support for debugging and for interfacing
CGAL to various visualization tools.<P>

<A NAME="Section_3"></A>
<H2>Organization</H2>

This part of the Reference Manual gives information that is relevant to
all three parts of the library.
Part&nbsp;1 of this Reference Manual covers the kernel, part&nbsp;2 the basic
library, and part&nbsp;3 the support library.<P>

Additional documents accompanying the CGAL distribution are
`The Use of STL and STL Extensions in CGAL', and
`Getting Started with CGAL'.
The former document gives a manual style introduction to STL constructs such
as iterators and containers, as well an extension, called circulator, used
in many places in CGAL.
The latter document gives an introduction in CGAL programming for the
novice user.<P>

Some functionality is considered more advanced.
Such functionality is described in sections like this one, bounded by
horizontal brackets.

<H2>Naming conventions</H2>
<P>

The use of representation classes not only avoids problems, it
also makes all CGAL classes very uniform. They <B>always</B> consist of:
<OL><P>

<LI>The <EM>name space prefix</EM> <I>CGAL_</I>. This avoids name
clashes. It will be dropped as soon as C++ compilers support the
concept of name spaces as a feature of the programming language.<P>

<LI>The <EM>capitalized base name</EM> of the geometric object, such as
<I>Point</I>, <I>Segment</I>, <I>Triangle</I>.<P>

<LI>An <EM>underscore</EM> followed by the <EM>dimension</EM> of the object,
for example <MATH>_2</MATH>, <MATH>_3</MATH> or <MATH>_d</MATH>.<P>

<LI>A <EM>representation class</EM> as parameter, which itself is
parameterized with a number type, such as <I>CGAL_Cartesian&lt;double&gt;</I>
or <I>CGAL_Homogeneous&lt;leda_integer&gt;</I>.
</OL><P>
