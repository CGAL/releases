<H1>Circulators</H1>

<A NAME="sectionCirculatorWarning"></A><P>

Circulators are quite similar to iterators that are described in
Chapter <A HREF="Chapter_Preliminaries.html#chapterIterators"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>. Circulators are a generalization of
pointers that allow a programmer to work with different circular data
structures like a ring <A HREF="list.html#Cross_link_anchor_24">list</A> in a uniform manner. Please note that
circulators are not part of the \stl, but of CGAL. The requirements
for circulators are presented here. Thereafter a number of adaptors
is described that convert between iterators and circulators.<P>

The specialization on circular data structures gives the reason for
the slightly different requirements for circulators than for
iterators. A circular data structure has no natural past-the-end
value. In consequence, a container supporting circulators will not
have an <TT>end()</TT>-member function, only a <TT>begin()</TT>-member
function. The semantic of a range is different for a circulator <MATH>c</MATH>:
The range <MATH>[c, c)</MATH> denotes the sequence of all elements in
the data structure. For iterators, this range would be empty. A
separate test for an empty sequence has been added to the
requirements. A comparison <MATH>c ==</MATH> <TT>NULL</TT> for a circulator <MATH>c</MATH>
tests whether the data structure is empty or not. An <TT>example()</TT>
function demonstrates a typical use of circulators. The function
accepts a range <MATH>[c, d)</MATH> of circulators and process each
element in this range.<P>

<PRE>
template &lt;class <A HREF="Circulator.html#Cross_link_anchor_6">Circulator</A>&gt;
void example( <A HREF="Circulator.html#Cross_link_anchor_6">Circulator</A> c, <A HREF="Circulator.html#Cross_link_anchor_6">Circulator</A> d)
{
    if (c != NULL) { // assures that there is at least one element
        do {
            foo(*c);  // process element
            ++c;
        } while (c != d);
    }
}
</PRE><P>

Given a circular data structure <MATH>S</MATH>, this function could be used
to process all elements like this: <TT>example(</TT><MATH>S</MATH><TT>.begin(),</TT><MATH>S</MATH><TT>.begin())</TT>.<P>

As for iterators, circulators come in different flavors. There are
<EM>forward, bidirectional</EM> and <EM>random access circulators</EM>.
They are either <EM>mutable</EM> or <EM>constant</EM>. The past-the-end
value is not applicable for circulators.<P>

<B>Reachability:</B>
A circulator <MATH>d</MATH> is called <EM>reachable</EM> from a circulator <MATH>c</MATH> if
and only if there is a finite sequence of applications of
<I>operator++</I> to <MATH>c</MATH> that makes <MATH>c == d</MATH>. If <MATH>c</MATH> and <MATH>d</MATH> refer
to the same non-empty data structure, then <MATH>d</MATH> is reachable from <MATH>c</MATH>,
and <MATH>c</MATH> is reachable from <MATH>d</MATH>. In particular, any circulator <MATH>c</MATH>
referring to a non-empty data structure will return to itself after a
finite sequence of applications of <I>operator++</I> to <MATH>c</MATH>.<P>

<B>Range:</B>
Most of the library's algorithmic templates that operate on data
structures have interfaces that use <EM>ranges</EM>. A range is a <A HREF="pair.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">pair</A> of
circulators that designate the beginning and end of the computation. A
range <MATH>[c, c)</MATH> is a <EM>full range</EM>; in general, a range
<MATH>[c, d)</MATH> refers to the elements in the data structure
starting with the one pointed to by <MATH>c</MATH> and up to but not including
the one pointed to by <MATH>d</MATH>. Range <MATH>[c, d)</MATH> is valid if and
only if both refer to the same data structure. The result of the
application of the algorithms in the library to invalid ranges is
undefined.<P>

<B>Warning:</B> Please note that the definition of a range is different
from that of iterators. An interface of a data structure must declare
whether it works with iterators, circulators, or both. \stl algorithms
always specify only iterators in their interfaces. A range <MATH>[c,
  d)</MATH> of circulators used in an interface for iterators will
work as expected as long as <MATH>c != d</MATH>. A range <MATH>[c, c)</MATH> will
be interpreted as the empty range like for iterators, which is
different than the full range that it should denote for circulators.<P>

Algorithms could be written to support both, iterators and
circulators, in a single interface. Here, the range <MATH>[c,
  c)</MATH> would be interpreted correctly. For more information how
to program your own applications to have this behavior, please refer
to the CGAL reference manual.<P>

As we mentioned in the introduction we are a little bit sloppy in the
presentation, in order to make it easier to understand. A class is
said to be a circulator if it fulfills a <A HREF="set.html#Cross_link_anchor_27">set</A> of requirements. In the
following sections we do not present the requirements, but we state
properties that are true, if the requirements are fulfilled. The
difference is best seen by an example: we write that the return value
of the test for equality returns a <I>bool</I>, but the requirement is
only that the return value is convertible to <I>bool</I>.<P>

<H2>Adaptor: Container with Iterators from <A HREF="Circulator.html#Cross_link_anchor_6">Circulator</A></H2>

<A NAME="sectionContainerFromCirc"></A><P>

Algorithms working on iterators could not be applied to circulators in
full generality, only to subranges (see the warning in
Section <A HREF="Chapter_Circulator_stl.html#sectionCirculatorWarning"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>). The following adaptors convert
circulators to iterators (with a space and time penalty) to
reestablish this generality.<P>

<H2>Adaptor: <A HREF="Circulator.html#Cross_link_anchor_6">Circulator</A> from Iterator</H2>

<A NAME="sectionCircFromIter"></A><P>

To obtain circulators, one could use a container class like those in
the Standard Template Library (\stl) or a <A HREF="pair.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">pair</A> of <I>begin()</I>-,
<I>end()</I>-iterators and one of the following adaptors. Adaptors
for <A HREF="iterator.html#Cross_link_anchor_1">iterator</A> pairs are described here, adaptors for container classes
are described in the next section.<P>
