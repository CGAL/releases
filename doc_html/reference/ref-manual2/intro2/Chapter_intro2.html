<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>

CGAL, the <EM>Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</EM>, is written in
C++ and consists of three parts.
The first part is the kernel, which consists of constant size non-modifiable
geometric primitive objects and operations on these objects.
The objects are parameterized by a representation class, which specifies
the underlying number types used for calculations.
The second part is a collection of basic geometric datastructures and
algorithms, which are parameterized by traits classes that define the
interface between the datastructure or algorithm, and the primitives they use.
The third part consists of non-geometric support facilities, such as
`circulators', random sources, I/O support for debugging and for interfacing
CGAL to various visualization tools.
Some of these facilities may depend on other tools or libraries, such as LEDA.<P>

<EM>This</EM> part of the reference manual covers the basic library.
The collection of basic geometric algorithms and datastructures
currently includes polygons, boolean operations, convex hulls, triangulations,
smallest enclosing circle, and range and segment trees.<P>

<H3>Organization of this Manual</H3>
<P>

This document is organized as follows.
Chapter <A HREF="../Polygon/Chapter_Polygon.html#Polygon"><IMG SRC="../cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> to <A HREF="../SearchStructures/Chapter_SearchStructures.html#Trees"><IMG SRC="../cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> present successively the following data
structures and algorithms: polygon, convex hull, triangulation, smallest
enclosing circle, and range and segment trees.<P>

<BR><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../cc_advanced_begin.gif" ALT="begin of advanced section"><BR>Some functionality of a number of classes and algorithms is considered more
advanced, for example because integrity of the underlying datastructure
is not guaranteed.
In such cases the programmer is responsible for integrity.
These functionalities are described in sections like this one, bounded by
horizontal brackets.
<BR><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../cc_advanced_end.gif" ALT="end of advanced section"><BR><H3>If you have a Problem</H3>
<P>

Should you have any questions, comments, remarks or criticism concerning
CGAL, please send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:cgal@cs.ruu.nl">&#60;cgal@cs.ruu.nl&#62;</A>.<P>

<H3>What is missing in this Release</H3>
<P>

This release of CGAL provides mostly two-dimensional primitives data
structures and algorithms.
Higher dimensional versions will be available soon.
More geometric datastructures and algorithms will become available in
future releases, for example spatial subdivisions.<P>
