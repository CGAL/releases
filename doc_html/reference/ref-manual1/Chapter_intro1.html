<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>

CGAL, the <EM>Computational Geometry Algorithms Library</EM>, is written in
C++ and consists of three parts.
The first part is the kernel, which consists of constant size non-modifiable
geometric primitive objects and operations on these objects.
The objects are parameterized by a representation class, which specifies
the underlying number types used for calculations.
The second part is a collection of basic geometric datastructures and
algorithms, which are parameterized by traits classes that define the
interface between the datastructure or algorithm, and the primitives they use.
The third part consists of non-geometric support facilities, such as
`circulators', random sources, I/O support for debugging and for interfacing
CGAL to various visualization tools.
Some of these facilities may depend on other tools or libraries, such as LEDA.<P>

<EM>This</EM> part of the reference manual covers the kernel.
The kernel contains objects of constant size, such as point, vector,
direction, line, ray, segment, triangle, iso-oriented rectangle and
tetrahedron.
With each type comes a set of functions which can be applied to an object
of this type.
You will typically find access functions (e.g. to the coordinates of a point),
tests of the position of a point relative to the object, a function returning
the bounding box, the length, or the area of an object, and so on.
The CGAL kernel further contains basic operations such as affine
transformations, detection and computation of intersections, and distance
computations.<P>

The correctness proof of nearly all geometric algorithms presented
in theory papers assumes exact computation with real numbers.
This leads to a fundamental problem with the implementation of geometric
algorithms.
Naively, often the exact real arithmetic is replaced by inexact floating-point
arithmetic in the implementation.
This often leads to acceptable results for many input data.
However, even for the implementation of the simplest geometric
algorithms this simplification occasionally does not work.
Rounding errors introduced by an inaccurate arithmetic may lead to
inconsistent decisions, causing unexpected failures for some correct
input data.
There are many approaches to this problem, one of them is to compute
exactly (compute so accurate that all decisions made by the algorithm
are exact) which is possible in many cases but more expensive
than standard floating-point arithmetic.
C. M. Hoffmann [<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_Ho_GSM">Hoffmann 90</A>, <A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_Ho_prec89">Hoffmann 89</A>] illustrates some
of the problems arising in the implementation of geometric algorithms
and discusses some approaches to solve them.
The exact computation paradigm is discussed by Yap and Dub&eacute;
[<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_Yap_exact_CCCG">Yap 93</A>].<P>

In CGAL you can choose the underlying number types and arithmetic.
You can use different types of arithmetic simultaneously and the choice can
be easily changed, e.g. for testing.
So you can choose between implementations with fast but occasionally inexact
arithmetic and implementations guaranteeing exact computation and exact
results.
Of course you have to pay for the exactness in terms of execution time
and storage space.
You can also design your own arithmetic and use it with the CGAL objects.
See `CGAL Reference Manual Part 3: Support Library' for more information
about number types.<P>

See `CGAL Reference Manual Part 2: Basic Library' for basic geometric
datastructures and algorithms such as polygons and boolean operations on them,
convex hull, triangulations, smallest enclosing circle, and range and segment
trees.
Another companion document is `The Use of STL and STL Extensions in CGAL'.<P>

<H3>CGAL and LEDA</H3>
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/LEDA/leda.html">LEDA</A>

is a <EM>Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms</EM> under development
at the <EM>Max-Planck Institut f&uuml;r Informatik</EM>, Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany.
CGAL is partially based on LEDA, and can be used with the combinatorial
part of it.
Note that CGAL is not built on top of the geometrical part of LEDA.<P>

<H3>Organization of this manual</H3>
<P>

This document is organized as follows.
Chapter <A HREF="Chapter_Preliminaries.html#Preliminaries"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> explains the basic concepts of the library.
It is a more technical introduction and we recommend to read it before the
rest of the manual.
Chapters <A HREF="Chapter_Preliminaries.html#PointVectorDirection"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> to <A HREF="Chapter_Object.html#ChapterObject"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> explain
basic types.
Each section in these chapters is self-contained.
It gives a complete description of a geometric type, i.e. the full set of
functions which can be applied on an object of this type.
We further give an example and describe how the underlying C++ class is
implemented.
Chapters <A HREF="Chapter_Predicates.html#Predicates"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> to <A HREF="Chapter_AffTransformation.html#AffTransformation"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> explain basic operations.<P>

<BR><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="cc_advanced_begin.gif" ALT="begin of advanced section"><BR>Some functionality is considered more advanced.
Such functionality is described in sections like this one, bounded by
horizontal brackets.
<BR><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="cc_advanced_end.gif" ALT="end of advanced section"><BR><H3>If you have a problem</H3>
<P>

Should you have any questions, comments, remarks or criticism
concerning CGAL, please send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:cgal@cs.ruu.nl">&#60;cgal@cs.ruu.nl&#62;</A>.<P>

<H3>What is missing in this release</H3>
<P>

This release of CGAL provides only two and three-dimensional primitives.
Higher dimensional versions will be available later.
Intersection routines and distance functions are not provided for all
combinations of geometric objects, especially not for curved objects.<P>
