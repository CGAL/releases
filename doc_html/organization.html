<P>
This document is organized as follows. 
Chapter <A HREF="Chapter_Numbertype.html#Numbertype">'Number Types'</A> 
describes some number types you might
use and briefly discusses their advantages and disadvantages.
The following chapters
explain the basic geometric types.  Each section in these chapters is self
contained: It gives a complete description of a geometric type, i.e.
the full set of functions which can be applied on an object of this
type. We further give an example and describe how the underlying
C++ class is implemented.  
Chapters <A HREF="Chapter_Predicates.html#Predicates">'Predicates'</A>
to <A HREF="Chapter_AffTransformation.html#AffTransformation">'Affine 
Transformation'</A> explain the basic operations. Finally
Chapter <A HREF="Chapter_Bbox_2.html#Bbox">'Bounding Boxes'</A> introduces 
the concept of the bounding box and explains where to use them.<P>
