<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>

<EM>This</EM> part of the reference manual covers the kernel.
The kernel contains objects of constant size, such as point, vector,
direction, line, ray, segment, triangle, iso-oriented rectangle and
tetrahedron.
With each type comes a set of functions which can be applied to an object
of this type.
You will typically find access functions (e.g. to the coordinates of a point),
tests of the position of a point relative to the object, a function returning
the bounding box, the length, or the area of an object, and so on.
The CGAL kernel further contains basic operations such as affine
transformations, detection and computation of intersections, and distance
computations.<P>

The correctness proof of nearly all geometric algorithms presented
in theory papers assumes exact computation with real numbers.
This leads to a fundamental problem with the implementation of geometric
algorithms.
Naively, often the exact real arithmetic is replaced by inexact floating-point
arithmetic in the implementation.
This often leads to acceptable results for many input data.
However, even for the implementation of the simplest geometric
algorithms this simplification occasionally does not work.
Rounding errors introduced by an inaccurate arithmetic may lead to
inconsistent decisions, causing unexpected failures for some correct
input data.
There are many approaches to this problem, one of them is to compute
exactly (compute so accurate that all decisions made by the algorithm
are exact) which is possible in many cases but more expensive
than standard floating-point arithmetic.
C.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Hoffmann&nbsp;[<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_h-gsm-89">Hof89a</A>, <A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_h-pargc-89">Hof89b</A>] illustrates some
of the problems arising in the implementation of geometric algorithms
and discusses some approaches to solve them.
A more recent overview is given in [<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_s-prgc-97">Sch97</A>].
The exact computation paradigm is discussed by Yap and Dub&eacute;
[<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_yd-ecp-95">YD95</A>] and Yap [<A HREF="biblio.html#Biblio_y-tegc-97">Yap97</A>].<P>

In CGAL you can choose the underlying number types and arithmetic.
You can use different types of arithmetic simultaneously and the choice can
be easily changed, e.g. for testing.
So you can choose between implementations with fast but occasionally inexact
arithmetic and implementations guaranteeing exact computation and exact
results.
Of course you have to pay for the exactness in terms of execution time
and storage space.<P>

<H3>CGAL and LEDA</H3>
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/LEDA/leda.html">LEDA</A>

is a <EM>Library of Efficient Data types and Algorithms</EM> under development
at the <EM>Max-Planck Institut f&uuml;r Informatik</EM>, Saarbr&uuml;cken, Germany.
CGAL is partially based on LEDA.
It makes a strong combination with the combinatorial part of it,
and can be used independently as well.<P>

<H3>Organization of this manual</H3>
<P>

This document is organized as follows.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_Preliminaries.html#Preliminaries"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> explains the basic concepts.
It is a more technical introduction and we recommend to read it before the
rest of the manual.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_Utilities.html#Utilities"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> introduces a number of notions used throughout
the kernel.
Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_Utilities.html#KernelOverview_2"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> through&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_SqDistance.html#SqDistance2"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> cover the
2D kernel, chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_SqDistance.html#KernelOverview_3"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A> through&nbsp;<A HREF="Chapter_AffTransformation_3.html#AffTransformation3"><IMG SRC="cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>
cover the 3D kernel.<P>
