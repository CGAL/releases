<H1>Number Type Support</H1>
<A NAME="Numbertype"></A><P>

CGAL representation classes are parameterized by number types.
Depending on the problem and the input data that have to be handled,
one has to make a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy in
order to select an appropriate number type and representation class.<P>

In homogeneous representation, two number types are involved,
although only one of them appears as a template parameter in
the homogeneous representation class.
This type, for sake of simplicity and readability called ring type is
used for the representation of homogeneous coordinates and all
internal computations.
If it is assured that the second operand divides the first one, these
internal computations are basically division-free.
The ring type is a placeholder for an integer type (or an integral
domain type) rather than for elements of arbitrary rings.
The name should remind you that the division operation is not
really needed (with the exception mentioned above) for this number type.
Of course, also more general number types can be used as a ring type
in a homogeneous representation class. In some computations, e.g. accessing
Cartesian coordinates, divisions cannot be avoided. In these computations a
second number type, the field type, is used. CGAL automatically generates
this number type as a <I><A HREF="CGAL_Quotient.html#Cross_link_anchor_1">CGAL_Quotient</A></I>. For the Cartesian representation
there is only one number type that is used for all calculations.<P>

The representation classes provide access to the number types
involved in the representation, although it is not expected that
such access is needed at this level, since low-level geometric
operations are wrapped in geometric primitives provided by CGAL.
This access can be useful if appropriate primitives are missing.
In a homogeneous representation class <I>R</I> ring type and field
type can be accessed as <I>R::RT</I> and <I>R::FT</I>, respectively.
The number type used in Cartesian representation is considered as
ring type and as field type depending on the context.
If can be accessed as <I>R::RT</I> and <I>R::FT</I>, according
to the use of number types used in the homogeneous counterpart.<P>

<A NAME="Section_1"></A>
<H2>Required Functionality of Number Types<A NAME="nt-requirements"></A></H2>

Number types must fulfill certain requirements, such that they can
be successfully used in CGAL code.
This section describes those requirements.
We focus on the syntactical requirements. Of course, number types also
have evident semantic constraints. They should be meaningful in the
sense that they approximate the integers or the rationals
or some other subfield of the real numbers.<P>

The requirements are described as a class interface of a class <I><A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A></I>,
with constructors, methods and the like.
This is only a matter of presentation.
In fact <I>double</I> and <I>float</I> also fulfill the requirements.<P>

<H3>Utility Function Classes</H3>

In addition to the utility routines listed above,
there are function object class templates corresponding to these functions.
Note that the function object class corresponding to <I>CGAL_sign</I> is
named <I>CGAL_Sgn</I> in order to avoid a conflict with the type
<I>CGAL_Sign</I>.<P>

CGALprovides the following function object classes:<P>

<I>#include &lt;CGAL/number_utils_classes.h&gt;</I><P>

<I>class CGAL_Min&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Max&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Abs&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Sgn&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Is_negative&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Is_positive&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Is_zero&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Is_one&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><I>class CGAL_Compare&lt;<A HREF="NT.html#Cross_link_anchor_0">NT</A>&gt;;</I><BR><A NAME="Section_3"></A>
<H2>Built-in Number Types</H2>
<P>

The built-in number types <I>float</I> and <I>double</I> have the
required arithmetic and comparison operators. They lack some required
routines though which are automatically included by CGAL.
<P>

All built-in number types of C++ can represent a discrete (bounded)
subset of the rational numbers only. We assume that the
floating-point arithmetic of your machine follows <TT>Ieee</TT>
floating-point-standard. Since the floating-point culture has much
more infrastructural support (hardware, language definition and
compiler) than exact computation, it is very efficient.
Like with all number types with finite precision representation
which are used as approximations to the infinite ranges of
integers or real numbers, the built-in number types are inherently
potentially inexact.
Be aware of this if you decide to use the efficient built-in
number types: you have to cope with numerical problems.
For example, you can compute the intersection point of two lines and
then check whether this point lies on the two lines.<P>

With floating point arithmetic,
roundoff errors may cause the answer of the check to be <I>false</I>.
With the built-in integer types overflow might occur.<P>

<H2>Number Types Provided by LEDA</H2>

<A NAME="leda-nt"></A><P>

LEDA provides number types that can be used for exact computation
with both Cartesian and homogeneous representation. If you are using
homogeneous representation with the built-in integer types
<I>short</I>, <I>int</I>, and <I>long</I> as ring type, exactness of
computations can be guaranteed only if your input data come from a
sufficiently small integral range and the depth of the computations is
sufficiently small. LEDA provides the number type <I>leda_integer</I> for
integers of arbitrary length. (Of course the length is
somehow bounded by the resources of your computer.) It can be used as
ring type in homogeneous representation and leads to exact
computation as long as all intermediate results are rational. For the
same kind of problems Cartesian representation with number type
<I>leda_rational</I> leads to exact computation as well.
The number type <I>leda_bigfloat</I> in LEDA is a variable precision
floating-point type. Rounding mode and precision (i.e. mantissa length) of
<I>leda_bigfloat</I> can be set.<P>

The most sophisticated number type in LEDA is the number type called
<I>leda_real</I>. Like in Pascal, where the name <I>leda_real</I> is used for
floating-point numbers, the name <I>leda_real</I> does not describe the
number type precisely, but intentionally.
<I>leda_reals</I> are a subset of real algebraic
numbers. Any integer is <I>leda_real</I> and <I>leda_real</I>s are closed under
the operations <MATH>+,-,*,/</MATH> and <MATH>k</MATH>-th root computation.<P>

<I>leda_real</I>s guarantee that
all comparisons between expressions involving <I>leda_real</I>s produce the
exact result.<P>

In the files <I>&lt;CGAL/leda_integer.h&gt;</I>, <I>&lt;CGAL/leda_rational.h&gt;</I>,
<I>&lt;CGAL/leda_bigfloat.h&gt;</I>, and <I>&lt;CGAL/leda_real.h&gt;</I>,
the LEDA types <I>leda_integer</I>, <I>leda_rational</I>,
<I>leda_bigfloat</I>,
and <I>leda_real</I> are made conform to the requirements presented in
<A HREF="Chapter_Numbertype.html#nt-requirements"><IMG SRC="../cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>.
Also, in these files the LEDA number types are included.
For more details on the number types of LEDA we refer to the LEDA
manual&nbsp;[<A HREF="../biblio.html#Biblio_mnu-lum-97">MNU97</A>].<P>

<A NAME="Section_6"></A>
<H2>Number Types Provided by GNU</H2>
<P>

CGAL provides wrapper classes for number types defined in the
<TT>Gnu</TT> Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library&nbsp;[<A HREF="../biblio.html#Biblio_Gmp">Gra96</A>].
The file <TT>CGAL/Gmpz.h</TT> provides the class <I><A HREF="CGAL_Gmpz.html#Cross_link_anchor_4">CGAL_Gmpz</A></I>,
a wrapper class for the integer type <I>mpz_t</I>, that is compliant to the
CGAL number type requirements.
To use this, the <TT>Gnu</TT> Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library must be
installed.<P>

<H2>User-supplied Number Types</H2>
<P>

You can also use your own number type with the CGAL representation
classes, e.g. the <TT>BigNum</TT> package [<A HREF="../biblio.html#Biblio_BigNum">SVH89</A>].
Depending on the arithmetic operations carried out by the algorithms
that you are going to use the number types must fulfill the
requirements from <A HREF="Chapter_Numbertype.html#nt-requirements"><IMG SRC="../cc_ref_up_arrow.gif" ALT="reference arrow" WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="10"></A>.<P>
