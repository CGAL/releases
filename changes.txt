- massive fix of const-correctness in Surface_mesher, Mesh_3,
Head_mesher dans Data_structure_for_queries_3.
  (A nice feature of C++ is that, when you need to add *one* const
   somewhere, then you have to fix const-correctness of all the World!)

12 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- new class Volume_mesher_default_triangulation_3
- new test, of io operators. It uses Volume_mesher_default_triangulation_3.
- fix i/o operators of <CGAL/Volume_mesher_cell_base_3.h>, in binary mode.
- fix <CGAL/Mesh_3/IO.h>, in case of binary mode.
- improved applications/lanteri.cpp. It know compute histograms of 
  dihedral min angles, too.

10 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- new debug macros:
  - CGAL_MESH_3_DIRTY_DEBUG_SPHERES,
  - and CGAL_MESHES_DEBUG_REFINEMENT_POINTS.
- new macro CGAL_MESHES_OUTPUT_STREAM, which is set to std::cout by
default.
- in Mesh_2: new header <CGAL/Mesh_2/Output_stream.h>
- new debug macro in <CGAL/Surface_mesher/Standard_criteria.h>
  - CGAL_MESH_3_DEBUG_CRITERIA
  Used in test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres*.cpp 

7 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- in test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres*.C:
  - new surface criterion class, named Uniform_size_multi_surface_criterion
    It does at the same time the job of
    CGAL::Surface_mesher::Vertices_on_the_same_surface_criterion
    and add size bounds, different for each surfaces.
  - This fixes the "combined_spheres hot spots" problem.

5 July 2006 Laurent Rineau
- move Point_traits.h from Mesh_3 to Surface_mesher, to avoid an unneeded
dependancy

28 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- another fix of Slivers_exuder

27 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- use filtered regular traits in applications/
- fixed Slivers_exuder so that it can pump vertices of surfaces too
  (Note: I may have broken things. I'll check tomorrow.)

26 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- in Surface_mesher:
  - remove deprecated include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface.h
  - rename CGAL::Surface_mesher::Implicit_surface_oracle to
           CGAL::Surface_mesher::Implicit_surface_oracle_3
    and then, rename include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface_oracle.h
    to include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Implicit_surface_oracle_3.h
- in Mesh_3: adapt code to the above change.

12 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- remove subdirectories of include/CGAL/Surface_mesher: files of Criteria/
  and Oracles/ are moved one step back.
- repear examples/Mesh_3/polyhedral_surface_mesher.C
- add two input files in ./inputs/*.off (with their medit files)

7 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- sliver exuder fixed,
- Combining_oracle fixed too.
- fix a robustness issue in examples/Mesh_3/implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.C:
  need to use CGAL::Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3 as geom_traits!!

6 June 2006 Laurent Rineau
- remove the old code Multi_implicit_oracle.h (in Surface_Mesher), and
multi_spheres.C (in Mesh_3).

1 May 2006 Laurent Rineau
- well... the exuder works, now!

1 May 2006 Laurent Rineau
- better checking of options, in
  examples/Mesh_3/implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.C
- in CGAL/Mesh_3/IO.h, new feature "Get_io_signature". It permits to
  verify that a file produced by the operator<< of an object is compatible
  with the operator>> of an object of another type, by comparing a
  "Input/Ouput signature".
- new applications/medit_to_cgal.C. It will work only when
  read_from_medit(), in include/CGAL/IO/File_edit.h, will be fixed.
- new macro CGAL_SURFACE_MESHER_MANIFOLD, that permits to choose between
  the manifold or non manifold version of Surface_mesher, in
  include/CGAL/Implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.h
- improved the class "Debug" in include/CGAL/IO/File_medit.h. I should
  perhaps publishit one day.
- include/CGAL/Mesh_3/Sliver_exuder.h is still under debugging!...
- change replay-skull a little, to test pumping...

6 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
- if the surface_index() of a point is 0, set it to 1, in
  include/CGAL/Mesh_3/Implicit_surface_mesher_visitor.h
  This visitor is passed to the Surface_mesher, when it is used from
  Mesh_3. This patch makes surface_index() of points on the surface to
  be 1, if is was 0.
- replay-skull now run correctly too.
- sliver exuder still crash. :-(
- the ImplicitFunction concept now has a operator()(Point), instead of
  operator()(FT, FT, FT).

5 April 2006 Laurent Rineau
- Too much changes, after Surface_mesher API changes.
- examples/Mesh_3/implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.C compiles
- applications/ too.
- examples/Mesh_3/replay-* almost runs correctly.
- This package is still under reconstruction. Do no expect any from it!

26 Febraury 2006 Laurent Rineau
- Move the internal header
include/CGAL/Mesh_3/Triangulation_mesher_level_traits_3.h to Mesh_2.


4 november 2005 Laurent Rineau
- modified Special_tets_criteria in test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres.C
  This criteria class has five size bounds, one for each sphere.
- new output/input operators in:
    include/CGAL/Mesh_3/Complex_2_in_triangulation_cell_base_3.h
  (in surface mesher:)
    include/CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_cell_base_3.h
    include/CGAL/Complex_2_in_triangulation_surface_mesh_cell_base_3.h
    include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index.h
    include/CGAL/Weighted_point_with_surface_index.h
  This permits to save/load meshes with i/o operators of Triangulation_3.


3 november 2005 Laurent Rineau
- modified applications/ tools
- rename functions:
     output_pslg_to_medit  -> output_to_medit
     input_pslg_from_medit -> input_from_medit

7 september 2005 Laurent Rineau
- "New" tools in the subdirectory applications/
  Actually, they were lost in the tools/ subdirectory of the package, that
  exists only in the branch 'sliver_branch'.
  They work, but are not adapted to the new framework Distribution_displayer.h

2 september 2005 Laurent Rineau
- in Surface_mesher:
    - new file include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index_geom_traits.h to have
      one class per file.
    - new files:
        include/CGAL/Weighted_point_with_surface_index.h
        include/CGAL/Point_with_surface_index_geom_traits.h
      so that CGAL::Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point> can
      have several additional constructors with Bare_point parameters.
    - two important hacks in files:
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Polyhedral.h
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h

      1/ Use of a new typedef Kernel_point, obtained by Kernel_traits, so
      these two classes work with Point_with_surface_index<Point> and
      Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point>. Some assign
      statement has to be used with a Kernel_point, so that they do not
      fail systematicaly (assign sucks!).

      2/ Use of CGAL::Random_points_in_sphere_3<Point, Point_creator> in
      include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h in function
      random_points(), so that this function does not use the contructor
      Point(double x, double y, double z). This implied that the tenmplate
      Implicit_oracle had a new template parameter, Point_creator, which I
      gave default
            Creator_uniform_3<typename GT::RT, typename GT::Point_3>.
      With Point_with_surface_index<Point> and
      Weighted_point_with_surface_index<Weighted_point> this creator should
      be defined. See ../Mesh_3/test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres.C and   
      ../Surface_mesher/examples/Surface_mesher/surfaces_union.C
    - same problem, file
        include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Point_surface_indices_visitor.h
      has been changed: Point_surface_indices_visitor<Tr> now has a
      templated new_point() function, so that is can take Kernel_point or
      Point as argument.
    - minor changes:
        - include/CGAL/IO/Complex_2_in_triangulation_3_file_writer.h now has
          correct copyright and #ifdef sentinel
        - include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Multi_implicit_oracle.h now
          has correct copyright
        - rename DT_3 into Tr, and GT_3 into Geom_traits in file
          include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Polyhedral.h
    - updated examples/Surface_mesher/surfaces_union.C so that it works.

TODO: - fix include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Multi_implicit_oracle.h as
        regards Kernel_point stuff
      - merge it with include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Implicit_oracle.h

- in Mesh_3:
    - include/CGAL/IO/File_medit.h :
        - fix namespace !!
        - some functions now takes a C2T3 as argument, now that C2T3 has a
        triangulation() getter.
        - new function input_pslg_from_medit() !! It reads indices.
        - output_pslg_to_medit() now uses surface_index() too 
    - new implementation of CGAL::Point_traits.h
    - tests:
        - test/Mesh_3/combined_spheres.C
          Now uses a class Point_with_surface_index_creator that is passed
          to Implicit_oracle.
          Now reads r1..r5 from std::cin, as well as the output medit file.
        - test/Mesh_3/multi_spheres.C 
          Updated: compiles but is still broken, because of
          Multi_implicit_oracle (see TODO below)
        - new shell script test/Mesh_3/spheres_create_input.sh (not
          submitted to CGAL) that helps to create .cin files for
          combined_sphere.C
    - examples:
        - examples/Mesh_3/implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.C
          Updated (use Weighted_point_with_surface_index_geom_traits and
          new API for output_pslg_to_medit())
          Compiles and should run correctly (I will see this week-end).
    - new directory applications/ (not submitted)
        - read_mesh.C reads medit files and display faces
          counts. Uses "utils.h" and "types.h"
        - stat_mesh.C does the same and displays vertices and facets counts
          by surfaces.
        - lanteri.C ad hoc application for fives spheres having same
          center. It uses:
            - lanteri_utils.h scans edges and cells
            - distribution.[Ch] computes and display distributions 
            - Distribution_displayer.h is an abstract base class used by 
            distribution.C
            - Gd_displayer.h and Qt_widget_displayer.h are two
            Distribution_displayer subclasses, with there
            implementations. Qt_widget_displayer is not currently used.
          Only lanteri.C (and lanteri_utils.h) needs CGAL. The other files can
          be compiled very quickly.
    - minor changes:
        - include/CGAL/IO/File_medit.h :
            - now has correct #ifdef sentinel
            - added missing includes
        - examples/Mesh_3/implicit_surfaces_mesher_3.C: rename T to tr
        - examples/Mesh_3/makefile is cleaned.

TODO: - examples/Mesh_3/polyhedral_surface_mesher.C is broken because:
        - output_pslg_to_medit() in include/CGAL/IO/File_medit.h need
          surface_index() in points. :-(
        - Weighted_point wp = Weighted_point(p, best_weight, index);
          in include/CGAL/Mesh_3/Slivers_exuder.h
        - add_in_graph() & o in vertices (this sucks!)
        - should use Weighted_point_with_surface_index_geom_traits
      - test/Mesh_3/multi_spheres.C is broken because 
          ../../../Surface_mesher/ \
                  include/CGAL/Surface_mesher/Oracles/Multi_implicit_oracle.h
        *is* broken.
      - File_medit.h should not require systematicaly surface_index()
      - provide .cin files for tests (read Dev'Manual)
