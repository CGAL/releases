This is the INSTALL file for creating the CGAL Kernel library
  

.......................................................................
1 How to install CGAL:

1.0 You should be in the directory CGAL-0.5/src

1.1 Modify the makefile. You have to adjust four things:
   
    (a) The compiler, either g++ (GNU), or CC (SUN, Silicon Graphics).
        Please have a look at README_RTTI if you are using g++.
   
    (b) The operating system of the machine where you are compiling.

    (c) The home directory of LEDA.
   
    (d) The home directory of CGAL.


1.2 If the include files and the libraries are not in subdirectories
    of the LEDA/CGAL home directories, you have to set four more
    variables (see Sect.2).
    

1.3 Type make lib

You now should have an archive file named libCGALkernel.a in the
directory  CGAL-0.5/lib/*_*   corresponding to the architecture of your
machine and the chosen compiler, e.g., lib/sunos5_g++  for the library
compiled with the GNU g++ compiler on a SUN with operating system OS5.


You can build the library for several compilers in a row, without
touching the source files, because the object files are also
in compiler/operating system dependent subdirectories of the directory
CGAL-0.5/src/obj/ 


1.4 Type make sharedlib

You can create shared libraries for some combinations of the compiler/
operating system. At the moment this is supported for Sun OS5 with CC 
and for SGI with CC.

2 How CGAL supports multiple architectures/compilers

The current setup of the makefiles guarantees that when you change 
the compiler the appropriate libraries are linked. This mechanism
depends on:

 o  the makefile variable CC, which should be set to g++ or CC

 o  the environment variable  CGAL_OSTYPE, which is either 
    sunos4 or sunos5 or  irix5.

As CGAL makes use of LEDA, this library should also be compiled 
for the different architectures/compilers. The makefiles suppose
that the four LEDA libraries libL.a, libG.a, libP.a and libW.a 
are in the directories  $(LEDA_DIR)/lib_$(CGAL_OSTYPE)_$(CC).

If this is not the case you should do the following:

 o  Either you overwrite the variables LEDA_INCL_DIR, LEDA_LIB_DIR, 
    CGAL_INCL_DIR and CGAL_LIB_DIR in the makefile.

 o  Or you make a directory with subdirectories lib/$(CGAL_OSTYPE)_$(CC)
    where you create symbolic links to the different physical libraries.

.......................................................................
3 Which architectures/compilers are supported?

Currently we support the following compilers:

 o  SUN Pro CC on SunOS4 (Bsd) and SunOS5 (Solaris)
 o  GNU g++2.7.2 on SunOS4 (Bsd) and SunOS5 (Solaris)
 o  SGI CC on Irix5 with patchSG0000556

If it compiles without problems on other architectures, the better,
but for the moment it has no priority for the CGAL project to support
more platforms. Our main concern is to offer more geometric classes
and algorithms.
