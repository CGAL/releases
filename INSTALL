INSTALL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file describes how to install CGAL on Unix or Unix-like systems
such as Linux, Solaris, Irix, and Cygwin on Windows. For installation
under Windows using native tools, see INSTALL.win32.

The documentation of CGAL is available in various formats (HTML,
PostScript, PDF). It is not bundled with the software but can be
downloaded separately at <http://www.cgal.org/Manual>.

For more information about CGAL, see the <http://www.cgal.org/>.

To install CGAL, you should:

 - download the compressed archive file from the CGAL web site
   http://www.cgal.org

 - unpack the file

 - build and install the CGAL libraries by running
        "./install_cgal --prefix=/usr/local" to install CGAL in /usr/local
              (or where ever else is desired) 
    The installer will try to locate the libraries used and required
    by CGAL. These libraries are detailed in the CGAL install notes at
    <http://www.cgal.org/Manual/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html>.

NOTE ON INTERACTIVE INSTALLS: the interactive installer, available by
running "./install_cgal -i" only works for in-place installs of CGAL
(ones where the libraries live in the CGAL source directory).  The
exception is Mac OS where installs from the interactive installer
work.

NOTE ON REPEATED INSTALLS: the installer maintains a cache in
config/install/ which records which external libraries were found as
well as the relevant environment variables. The cached values are used
on subsequent runs of the installer on the same architecture. Delete
the contents of this directly if the environment has changed (for
example, boost or GMP was installed or the CPPFLAGS changed) and you
want the installer to pick up these changes.
