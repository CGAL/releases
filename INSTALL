The documentation of CGAL is available in various formats (HTML, PostScript,
PDF). It is not bundled with the software but can be downloaded separately.

To install CGAL, you should:

  - download the compressed archive file from the CGAL web site www.cgal.org

  - unpack the file in the place in which you wish to install it

  - install the CGAL libraries: 
    the impatient can just try to run "./install_cgal -i", but we recommend
    to first have a look at the Installation notes. 
    These are available in several formats. A PostScript file named
    installation.ps.gz can be found in the directory doc_ps.
