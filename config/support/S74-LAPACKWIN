# LAPACK is a linear algebra library.
# We search for a LAPACK library named "liblapack.lib". It may be an hybrid LAPACK/Atlas library, 
# which is the solution recommended by ATLAS. See http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp.
# Note: this configuration has been tested with VisualC++ 7.1.
