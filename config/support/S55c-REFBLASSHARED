# BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).
# We search for the BLAS reference implementation
# (http://www.netlib.org/blas)
# compiled as a shared library.
# This configuration *must* be the last try as this library is notably
# slow. Note that if the "atlas" RPM is installed, the optimized BLAS in
# Atlas will be loaded at runtime.
# This configuration has been tested on Fedora with the "blas-devel" RPM (g++).
