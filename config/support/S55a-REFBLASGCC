# BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
# We search for the BLAS reference implementation (http://www.netlib.org/blas)
# compiled by g77.
# This configuration *must* be the last try as this library is notably slow.
# Note: this configuration has been tested with:
# - "lapack" package for Cygwin
# - "blas" RPM for Linux Fedora
