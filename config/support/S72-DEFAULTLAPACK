# LAPACK is a linear algebra library.
# We search for a LAPACK library named "liblapack.a/.so". It may be an hybrid LAPACK/Atlas library,
# which is the solution recommended by ATLAS. See http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp.
# Note: this configuration has been tested with:
# - "lapack" package for Cygwin
# - "lapack-devel" RPM for Linux Fedora
