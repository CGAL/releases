CGAL makes use of run time type identification (RTTI), which is 
either offered by the compiler (for GNU and SGI), or which is 
partially provided by CGAL (for SUN CC).


For the GNU compiler there is the following problem: RTTI is 
switched on via a compile time switch. If you write CGAL code and 
use any other code not compiled with that switch, e.g. LEDA  you 
might get problems. Concerning LEDA, you first have to compile LEDA 
with that switch. The procedure is as follows:

 1.  Go to the LEDA home directory.

 2.  type lconfig g++

 3.  Take the file ./src/Make.src in your favorite editor and add
     the compile time switch  -frtti -D_POSIX_SOURCE as follows:

CGAL = -frtti -D_POSIX_SOURCE -DCGAL_RTTI

     $(CC) -DLEDA_INSTALL -I../../incl $(CFLAGS) $(CGAL) $(DFLAGS) -c $*.c



 4. Take the files ./include/LEDA/basic.h,  ./include/LEDA/base_window.h
    and ./src/x11/_x11.c in your editor and add the following before the 
    first #include statement

#ifdef CGAL_RTTI
#include <std/typeinfo.h>
#endif  // CGAL_RTTI


 5. If you are on a SUN, take the file ./include/LEDA/basic.h in your
    editor and put the following lines in a comment:

LEDA::LEDA()  
{ 
 .....
    //    tm* T = localtime(&clock);
 .....
    //    log << string("  %02d:%02d:%02d", T->tm_hour,T->tm_min,T->tm_sec);
    //  log << string("  %d/%d/19%d", T->tm_mday,T->tm_mon,T->tm_year);
 .....
}


 6. Go in the LEDA home directory and compile LEDA by typing
    make lib
