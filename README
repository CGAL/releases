Changes
=======

The major changes of CGAL-2.2 with respect to release CGAL-2.1.

Supported platforms
-------------------

The Borland C++ compiler version 5.5 (which is the compiler of C++Builder 5
and the freely available Borland compiler).
The KAI compiler (version 4.0) has been tested under Solaris 2.8.


The following functionality has been added
------------------------------------------

New optimisation algorithms
  o Min_annulus_d
    Algorithm for computing the smallest enclosing annulus of points
    in arbitrary dimension 

  o Polytope_distance_d
    Algorithm for computing the (squared) distance between
    two convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension

  o Width_3
    Algorithm for computing the (squared) width of points sets
    in three dimensions

There is a new, non-reference counted kernel, Simple_cartesian. Because
reference counting is not used, and thus coordinates are stored within a
class, debugging is easier using this kernel.

About 2d Triangulations
- There are now two triangulation data structures available in CGAL.
  The new one uses a list to store the faces and allows one to represent 
  two-dimensional triangulations embedded in three spaces as well as
  planar triangulations.
- The triangulation hierarchy which allows fast location query
  is now available.


The 3d triangulation now allows removal of vertices as well as insertions.

A function that generates random simple polygons is now available.

In directory demo/Robustness programs that demonstrate typical robustness
problems in geometric computing are presented along with the solutions to
these problems that CGAL provides.



The following functionality has been removed
--------------------------------------------

The binary operations on polygons (union, intersection ...) have been removed.
Those operations were not documented in the previous release (2.1).
Arrangements can often be used as a substitute.
