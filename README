This distribution of CGAL includes:

   auxiliary/         - directory containing additional things distributed 
                        with CGAL but not part of the library (in particular,
                        the GNU multi-precision number type). The gmp library
                        has its own license.

   config/            - directory containing several test programs used in

   demo/              - a directory containing many demo programs for the

                        LEDA or libCGALwin installed (see the INSTALLATION 
                        file).  Others programs require geomview, which is 
                        available from www.geomview.org
