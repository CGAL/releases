CGAL KERNEL README

Release 0.2

.......................................................................
The files are organized as follows:

Cgal/include/CGAL/*.h        --- header files
Cgal/src/*.C                 --- C++ source code

Cgal/manual.ps               --- The User Manual

Cgal/example/*               --- An example application
        

.......................................................................
How to install CGAL:

0. Goto CGAL's home directory, that is  Cgal/.

1. Modify makefile:
   Adjust the paths where to find LEDA and CGAL's home directory

2. Type gmake   (gmake is gnu's make)

You now should have an archive file named libCGALkernel.a in the
CGAL home directory.


3. The manual comes in A4 format. It is written in LaTeX book style
   and you obtain a little booklet if you use the ps2book command. 

.......................................................................
How to use CGAL in your own application? 

You best look at the directory Cgal/example. It gives you a master
makefile and an example application program.C. You can compile it by
the call "gmake program"   in the directory Cgal/example.



.......................................................................
Getting simple ASCII stream output

For each geometric class CGAL provides an output operator<<(..).

You can switch this feature off by removing the compiler option
-DCGAL_IO from Cgal/makefile.

What if you have problems?

First have a look at the manual. Maybe we only have explained it in
an obscure way and a second look at it reveals what we really meant.

If that does not help ask the local CGAL responsable. 

If that does not help have a look at the header file and send an 
email to the person who wrote the code. Most probably you will find
