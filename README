The installed version is CGAL-0.901, i.e. the official 0.9 version with a 
few corrections made by stschirr@mpi-sb.mpg.de. Version 1.0 is coming soon!

CGAL documentation is available online through doc_html/index.html. Postscript
versions of the reference manual, a `getting started' document and a document on STL 
and CGAL are in doc_ps, printed versions are in a CGAL-folder in AG1's group 
library. 
The directory `examples' contains example programs. Especially, it contains a 
makefile. To compile with CGAL, you should include a CGAL_MAKEFILE designed for your
platform and wishes, and use the macros defined there. See examples/makefile
for an example. See the make/README for some info on the names of the available
makefiles.
There are name conflicts with STL and LEDA. To work around this you have to use 
some tricks, e.g. (un)prefix STL (you may, of course, prefer to maintain your own 
prefixed leda_version) by including CGAL/(un)prefix_stl.h. 
The g++-version uses the RTTI-feature, which affects the organization of class data.
Don't mix code compiled with and without that feature.

Enjoy CGAL and its flexibility!

The CGAL project
----------------

The CGAL Consortium consists of Utrecht University (The Netherlands), 
ETH Zurich (Switzerland), Free University of Berlin (Germany), 
INRIA Sophia-Antipolis (France), Max-Planck-Institute Saarbrucken
(Germany), RISC Linz (Austria), and Tel-Aviv University (Israel).
The CGAL Consortium can be reached via email: cgal@cs.ruu.nl
The CGAL project has a WWW page http://www.cs.ruu.nl/CGAL/.

The goal of the project is to design and implement a robust, easy to use,
and efficient C++ software library of geometric algorithms.

The project is funded by European Union's information technologies programme
Esprit, as Project 21957 - CGAL.



The Release
-----------

This is release 0.9 of the CGAL library. It is the first public release.
The version number smaller than 1 indicates that it is considered a beta
release.

Installation procedures are described in subdirectory doc_ps in file install,ps
and subdirectory doc_html in file install.html. The content of those files is
the same, the format is different (PostScript and HTML). You are advised to
read this installation guide before you install CGAL. The installation process
itself is done by the script install_cgal.

The directories doc_html and doc_ps contain documentation of the CGAL library.
The directory examples contains examples.
Directories src and include contain the code for the CGAL library.
The directory auxiliary contains a patch for g++ that is recommended if you use
CGAL with g++-2.7.2. Furthermore it contains the Gnu multi precision library,
which can be used together with CGAL.
