Changes
=======

The major changes of CGAL-2.1 with respect to release CGAL-2.0.

Supported platforms
-------------------

We support the newest gnu compiler (2.95.2) on Sun, Mips, Linux and Windows.
We support the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, version 6.
We support the mips CC compiler version 7.3 under Irix.
Support for the old g++ compiler (2.8) and for mips CC 7.2 has been dropped.


The following functionality has been added
------------------------------------------

Alpha shapes and weighted alpha shapes in 2D. Alpha shapes are a
generalization of the convex hull of a point set.

Arrangements in 2D. Arrangements are related to and based on planar maps.
The major difference between the two is that curves are allowed to intersect
in the case of arrangements.

Extensions to triangulations in 2D.
Constrained triangulations are now dynamic: they support insertions of new 
constraint as well as  removal of constraints.
There are also constrained Delaunay triangulations.

Triangulations in 3D were added, both Delaunay triangulations and regular
triangulations.

Min_quadrilateral optimisations have been added..
This are algorithms to compute the minimum enclosing rectangle/parallelogram
(arbitrary orientation) and the minimum enclosing strip of a convex point set. 

2d Point_set is a package for 2d range search operations, Delaunay
triangulation, nearest neighbor queries. This package works only if LEDA
is installed.

Support for GeoWin visualization library. This depends also on LEDA.

Support for using the CLN number type together with CGAL.
The CLN library is available at http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-cln.html
