----------------------------- Release 2.3 ------------------------------------

Version 2.3 differs from version 2.3 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.

Additional supported platforms:

   Gnu g++ 3.0 on Solaris, Linux 

The following functionality has been added:

Kernels:

   - The 2D and 3D kernels now serve as models of the new kernel concept
     described in the recent paper, "An Adaptable and Extensible Geometry
     Kernel" by Susan Hert, Micheal Hoffmann, Lutz Kettner, Sylvain Pion, 
     and Michael Seel to be presented at WAE 2001 (and soon available as
     a technical report).  This new kernel is completely compatible with 
     the previous design but is more flexible in that it allows geometric 
     predicates as well as objects to be easily exchanged and adapted 
     individually to users' needs.

   - A new kernel called Simple_homogeneous<> is available. It is equivalent 
     to Homogeneous<> but without reference-counted objects.

   - A new kernel called Filtered_kernel<> is available that allows one to 
     build kernel traits classes that use exact and efficient predicates.

   - There are two classes, Cartesian_converter<> and Homogeneous_converter
     that allows one to convert objects between different Cartesian and
     homogeneous kernels, respectively. 
 
   - A new d-dimensional kernel, Kernel_d is available.  It provides diverse 
     kernel objects, predicates and constructions in d dimensions with two 
     representations based on the kernel families Cartesean_d and Homogeneous_d
 
Basic Library:

   Almost all packages in the basic library have been adapted to the
   new kernel design to realize the flexibility this design makes possible.
   In several packages, this means that the traits class requirements have
   changed to conform to the function objects offered in the kernels so the
   kernels themselves can be used as traits classes in many instances.

   2D Convex Hull 
     - The traits requirements have changed slightly.

   3D Convex Hull 
     - The convex_hull_3 function now uses a new implementation of the 
       quickhull algorithm that no longer requires LEDA.
     - A new convex_hull_incremental_3 function based on the new d-dimensional
       convex hull class is available for comparison purposes

  Convex_hull_d, Delaunay_d
     Two new application classes offering the calculation of d-dimensional
     convex hulls and delaunay triangulations

  Polygon

    - The traits class requirements have been changed.
    - The simplicity test has a completely new implementation.
    - Properties like convexity, simplicity and area can now be cached by
      polygons. You need to set a flag to select this behaviour.

  Planar Nef Polyhedra
     A new class (Nef_polyhedron_2) representing planar Nef polyhedra = 
     rectilinearly bounded points sets that are the result of binary and 
     topological operations starting from halfplanes.

  Planar Polygon Partitioning
     New package offering functions to partition planar polygons into
     convex and y-monotone pieces.

  Planar Maps and Arrangements 

     - A new class Planar_map_with_intersections_2<Planar_map> for planar maps
       of possibly intersecting, possibly non-x-monotone, possibly overlapping
       curves (like Arrangement_2 but without the hierarchy tree).

     - I/O utilities for planar maps and arrangements for textual and
       graphical streams. (It is possible to save and later reload built
       planar maps or arrangements.) 

     - New arrangement traits class for line segments and circular arcs
       (Arr_segment_circle_traits<NT>). 

     - New faster traits for polylines specialized for using the LEDA
       rational kernel (Arr_leda_polylines_traits). The LEDA traits for
       segments was also made faster.

     - A new point location strategy (Pm_simple_point_location<Planar_map>).

  Halfedge Data Structure 
     The halfedge data structure has been completely revised. The new design
     is more in line with the STL naming scheme and it provides a safe and
     coherent type system throughout the whole design (no void* pointers
     anymore), which allows for better extendibility. A user can add new
     incidences in the mesh easily. The new design also uses standard
     allocators with a new template parameter that has a suitable default.
         
     The old design is still available, but its use is deprecated, see the
     manual of deprecated packages for its documentation. Reported bugs in
     copying the halfedge data structure (and therefore also polyhedral
     surfaces) have been fixed in both designs. Copying a list based 
     representation is now based on hash maps instead of std::map and
     therefore considerably faster.

  Polyhedral Surface
     The polyhedral surface has been rewritten to work with the new
     halfedge data structure design. The user level interface of the
     CGAL::Polyhedron_3 class is almost backwards compatible with the
     previous class. The exceptions are the template parameter list,
     everything that relies on the flexibility of the underlying
     halfedge data structure, such as a self written facet class, and
     that the distinction between supported normals and supported planes
     has been removed. Only planes are supported. See the manuals for
     suggestions how to handle normals instead of planes.
         
     More example programs are provided with polyhedral surfaces,
     for example, one about Euler operator and one computing a subdivision
     surface given a control mesh as input.
         
     The old design is still available for backwards compatibility and to
     support older compiler, such as MSVC++6.0. For the polyhedral surface,
     old and new design cannot be used simultaneously (they have identical
     include file names and class names). The include files select
     automatically the old design for MSVC++6.0 and the new design
     otherwise. This automatism can be overwritten by defining appropriate
     macros before the include files. The old design is selected with the
     CGAL_USE_POLYHEDRON_DESIGN_ONE macro. The new design is selected with
     the CGAL_USE_POLYHEDRON_DESIGN_TWO macro.


  2D Triangulation

     The geometric traits class requirements have been changed to conform
     to the new CGAL kernels.  CGAL kernel classes can be used as traits
     classes for all 2D triangulations except for regular triangulations.

     Additionnal functionality:
        - dual method for regular triangulations (to build a power diagram)
        - unified names and signatures for various "find_conflicts()" 
          member functions in Delaunay and constrained Delaunay triangulation.
        - As an alternative to the simple insert() member function,
          insertion of points in those triangulation can be performed using the
          combination of find_conflicts() and star_hole() which eventually
          allows the user to keep track of deleted faces.

     More demos and examples

  3D Triangulation

     Major improvements 
       - A new class Triangulation_hierarchy_3 that allows a faster point 
         location, and thus construction of the Delaunay triangulation
       - A new method for removing a vertex from a Delaunay triangulation 
         that solves all degenerate cases
       - Running time of the usual location and insertion methods improved 

     A bit more functionality, such as
        - New geomview output 
        - dual methods in Delaunay triangulations to draw the Voronoi diagram

     More demos and examples 

     Changes in interface
        - Traits classes requirements have been modified 
        - The kernel can be used directly as a traits class (except for 
          regular triangulation)
        - insert methods in Triangulation_data_structure have a new interface 

  3D Alpha shapes
     A new class (Alpha_shapes_3) that computes Alpha shapes of point sets
     in 3D is available.

  Geometric Optimisation

     The traits requirements for Matrix_search and Min_quadrilateral_2
     have been changed to bring them in line with the CGAL kernels.

  Point_set_2

    - now independent of LEDA, based on the CGAL Delaunay triangulation and
      converted to kernel traits
    - function template versions of the provided query operations


Support Library:
----------------
  In_place_list has a new third template parameter 
        (with a suitable default) for an STL-compliant allocator.

  Unique_hash_map is a new support class. 

  Geomview_stream :
    - Geomview version 1.8.1 is now required.
    - no need to have a ~/.geomview file anymore.
    - new output operators for triangulations.
    - new output operators for Ray_2, Line_2, Ray_3, Line_3, Sphere_3.
    - various new manipulators.

  Number types :
    - Lazy_exact_nt<NT> is a new number type wrapper to speed up exact 
      number types.
    - MP_Float is a new multiprecision floating point number type. It can 
      do exact additions, subtractions and multiplications over 
      floating point values.

  Window stream
    In cooperation with Algorithmic Solutions, GmBH (distributors of
    the LEDA library), we can now offer a visualization package 
    downloadable in binary form that support visualization on a ported
    version of the LEDA window lib.


----------------------------- Release 2.2 ------------------------------------

Version 2.2 differs from version 2.2 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.

Additional supported platforms:

   - the KAI compiler (4.0) on Solaris 5.8
   - Borland C++ (5.5)

The following functionality has been added:

  -  There is a new, non-reference-counted kernel, Simple_cartesian. Because
     reference counting is not used, and thus coordinates are stored within a
     class, debugging is easier using this kernel.  This kernel can also be
     faster in some cases than the reference-counted Cartesian kernel.

  -  New optimisation algorithms:

         --  Min_annulus_d - Algorithm for computing the smallest enclosing 
             annulus of points in arbitrary dimension
         --  Polytope_distance_d - Algorithm for computing the (squared) 
             distance between two convex polytopes in arbitrary dimension
         --  Width_3 - Algorithm for computing the (squared) width of points 
             sets in three dimensions

  -  2D Triangulations
     
        --  There are now two triangulation data structures available in CGAL.
            The new one uses a list to store the faces and allows one to 
            represent two-dimensional triangulations embedded in three spaces 
            as well as planar triangulations.
        --  The triangulation hierarchy which allows fast location query
            is now available.

  -  Inifinite objects can now be included in planar maps.

  -  Removal as well as insertions of vertices for 3D Delaunay triangulations 
     is now possible.

  -  A generator for ``random'' simple polygons is now available.

  -  In directory demo/Robustness, programs that demonstrate typical robustness
     problems in geometric computing are presented along with the solutions to
     these problems that CGAL provides.

The following functionality has been removed:

   --  The binary operations on polygons (union, intersection ...) have been 
       removed since the code could not be adapted to all supported 
       platforms.  Arrangements can often be used as a substitute.

--------------------------------- Release 2.1 --------------------------------

Version 2.1 differs from version 2.0 in the platforms that are supported and
in functionality.

Supported platforms:

     -  the newest gnu compiler (2.95.2) on Sun, SGI, Linux and Windows.
     -  the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, version 6.
     -  the mips CC compiler version 7.3 under Irix.

Support for the old g++ compiler (2.8) and for mips CC 7.2 has been dropped.

The following functionality has been added:

  -  Alpha shapes and weighted alpha shapes in 2D. Alpha shapes are a
     generalization of the convex hull of a point set.
  -  Arrangements in 2D. Arrangements are related to and based on planar maps.
     The major difference between the two is that curves are allowed to 
     intersect in the case of arrangements.
  -  Extensions to triangulations in 2D.  Constrained triangulations are now 
     dynamic: they support insertions of new constraint as well as removal of 
     existing constraints.  There are also constrained Delaunay triangulations.
  -  Triangulations in 3D were added, both Delaunay triangulations and regular
     triangulations.
  -  Min_quadrilateral optimisations have been added.  These are algorithms to 
     compute the minimum enclosing rectangle/parallelogram (arbitrary 
     orientation) and the minimum enclosing strip of a convex point set. 
  -  2d Point_set is a package for 2d range search operations, Delaunay
     triangulation, nearest neighbor queries. This package works only if 
     LEDA is installed.
  -  Support for GeoWin visualization library. This also depends on LEDA.
  -  Support for using the CLN number type together with CGAL.
