Note that the Makefile in this directory is meant as an example Makefile
for building the GeoWin library with g++.
However the recommended way to build the GeoWin library 
(especially on other platforms like MIPSPRO CC or Visual C++) is to build it
together with the other LEDA libs (lconfig / make or make_lib) in the
LEDA installation process. 
The provided sources in this directory are identical to the sources
coming with LEDA 4.0; note that you need this version of LEDA to use
GeoWin because of some important changes in the LEDA window library.
