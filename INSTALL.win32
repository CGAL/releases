$CGAL/INSTALL.win32
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to install CGAL on MS Windows for
Developer Studio .net 2003 (VC 7.1) and 2005 (VC 8.0) 

Note that you also can install CGAL with the Microsoft compilers using
cygwin. For installation on Unix systems and on cygwin, please see
INSTALL document.

The documentation of CGAL is available in html and pdf format. It is
not bundled with the software but can be downloaded separately.

For more information about CGAL, see the URL http://www.cgal.org/.


Installation
Download the Windows installer from the CGAL Download section. Run it and make
sure you carefully read the instructions from each installation step.


Boost
CGAL needs some parts of Boost. You can download it from http://www.boost.org.
It is enough to unzip the file. Currently only demo programs
in the Kinetic_data_structures directory need the compiled Boost
library program_options.
Alternatively you can use the Installer for Boost provided
by Boost Consulting: http://www.boostconsulting/download.html.
It allows you to select precompiled libraries. 


GMP and MPFR

Some examples and demos need GMP. The CGAL Installer installs
precompiled versions of GMP 4.1.4 and MPFR 2.1.0. in the directory
CGAL-3.2/auxiliary/gmp. 
We compiled GMP and MPFR with the /MD option, in release mode, and we 
didn't use processor specific assembler.


Qt

Most demos use Qt 3. You can download it from http://www.trolltech.no.
You must build the multi-threaded version (/MD).


TAUCS

Only examples in the Surface_mesh_parameterization directory need TAUCS.

The CGAL Installer installs a precompiled version of TAUCS in the
directory CGAL-3.2/auxiliary/taucs. We compiled TAUCS with the /MD option and 
linked with the ATLAS library.
The ATLAS library provides BLAS . It is precompiled with the /MD option 
and optimized for a Pentium 4 processor with SSE2 instructions. 
If ATLAS is slow or crashes on your machine, please recompile it. Source code 
can be downloaded from the official site http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net 
or from the Download section of http://www.cgal.org.
Due to an incompatibility between ATLAS and Visual C++ debugger, we provide 
also the Blas and Lapack reference implementations. They are notably slow and 
should be used only for debugging.

You may use TAUCS with other Blas libraries like Intel's MKL, AMD Core Math 
Library or Goto Blas.
You can download the official source code from http://www.tau.ac.il/~stoledo/taucs
or download a version modified for the /MD option from the Download section
of http://www.cgal.org.
See TAUCS documentation to create a "variant" makefile to compile TAUCS 
with the /MD option and the appropriate Blas library.


Zlib

Currently only demo programs in the Surface_mesher directory need Zlib.
The CGAL Installer comes with Zlib precompiled.


Paths for Header Files and Libraries

The individual project files do not specify where the header
files from Boost, GMP/MPFR, Qt, TAUCS, Zlib etc. are located.  You must add
these paths for Developer Studio in Tools->Options->Projects->VC++Directories
in the tab "Show Directories" for "Include Files" and "Library Files".
The CGAL Installer tries to write the paths in a .net 2003 (VC 7.1) configuration 
file.  If it does not succeed it shows a warning that you have to add it.

If you intend to use VC++ from a MS-DOS Prompt Shell, add the same paths
to the %INCLUDE% and %LIB% environment variables.


Building the Library

The CGAL.lib is already precompiled for .net 2003 (VC 7.1) and located in
CGALROOT/lib/msvc7/CGAL.lib.  It is built using the /MD compiler
option. If you want to rebuild CGAL.lib you should go into the
CGALROOT/src/CGAL directory and open cgallib.vcproj using Developer
Studio. Go to the "Build" menubar and press on "Rebuild Solution".
The CGAL library will be created in CGALROOT/lib/msvc7/ as CGAL.lib.


Building the Demos

The demos come in CGALROOT/demo directory. Each demo directory contains the
VC++ .NET project files. To build one demo you should open one of those files.
The demos need Qt installed. The projects are configured for commercial users.
The libraries that are used are qt-mt.lib and qtmain.lib, and you should change
manually those settings if you have a different version of Qt or you have
built Qt with single thread support. All the demos use also the CGALQt.lib that
represents the Qt_widget library also developed in the CGAL project.


Running the Examples and Demos

The corresponding executable(s) then can be run as usual, from the
command prompt, or via Explorer.


NOTE for VC 2005 Users

This product can convert the project files of .net 2003 (VC 7.1). CGAL provides only
project files for .net 2003 (VC 7.1) because you should convert them without problems
using the new product. The other way around is not possible.
