The paper presents an algorithm for deciding whether in a given strip (of size
$N$) the vertical distances of a straight line to the nearest integer grid 
point is less than a given epsilon. The author claims that this is an important
substep in an algorithm for correctly rounding transcendentals (I could not
check this, because I had no access to the "rounding transcendentals"-paper).
Furthermore, the author claims that concerning  practice the new algorithm is a 
significant improvement over the "naive"-method used before. The naive method
has always running time in $\Theta(N)$, while the worst-case running time of
the new method is $\Theta(N)$, but the best case is in $o(N)$. However, it is 
not clear how likely the worst-case happens.

The algorithm is nice and non-trivial and exploits interesting mathematical 
theory. It seems to be correct, although there might be a problem with accuracy
in an actual implementation. The algorithm is probably very relevant for
a specific approach to the "rounding transcendentals"-problem (table maker's 
problem). I doubt, however, that it is of more general relevance. From a 
computational geometry point of view I don't see that the paper is of general
interest. But this is a very focussed point of view, the algorithm might be
much more interesting from a computer arithmetic point of view. 

After all, I like the result, but I doubt its importance. Thus, my score 
for the paper is only 3 (If there are important applications I did not see, 
the score should be higher).
