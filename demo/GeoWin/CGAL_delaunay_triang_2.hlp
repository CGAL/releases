Delaunay triangulation demo

This demo program lets you input points for
the construction of a Delaunay triangulation.

There are 3 other input scenes as well:

- Input for line walk: demonstrates the line walk function

- Input for point location: demonstrates point location on 
  the Delaunay triangulation (locates a face)

- Input for nearest vertex search: input for nearest vertex search on the
Delaunay triangulation

Activate these scenes using the activate submenu in the
Scenes menu.
