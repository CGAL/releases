CGAL Planar map demo

This demo program lets you construct a planar map.
Construct the planar map using the scenes

- CGALPointList and

The program will show you the faces of the planar map in
different colors.

Activate the scene CGALPointList-2 to input points that
are used to demonstrate the locate routine of the planar
