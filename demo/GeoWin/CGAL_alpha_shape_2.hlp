The demo program lets you construct the
Alpha shape of an input point set.

The Alpha shape is a data structure based
on the Delaunay triangulation of the point set
used for shape reconstruction algorithms

We display in yellow color the Delaunay triangulation,
in green color the Alpha shape.

Change the Alpha value to see how the Alpha shape
changes. For Alpha = 0 the Alpha shape is only
the point set, for Alpha  infinity the Alpha
shape is the convex hull.
