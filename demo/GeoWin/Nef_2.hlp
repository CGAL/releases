This demo lets you input two simple polygons.
We show the result of boolean operations on these two
polygons. 
The result of the boolean operation is computed using
the Nef polyhedron class of CGAL.
This class is able to compute the results of the boolean
operation even if it is only a segment or point.

Note that you have to input the simple polygons counter-clockwise
if you want to use the INTERIOR for the boolean operation.
