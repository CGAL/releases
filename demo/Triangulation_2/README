DEMOS   :
---------
These demos makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA or CGAL::WINDOW
to be installed

demo:
Illustrates different features of the  basic triangulation and of Delaunay Triangulation
input points with left button
delete points with middle button
quit with right button

regular_demo
a demo for regular triangulations
input points with left button
delete points with middle button
quit with right button

constrained
A demo for the constrained triangulation.
The constraints are read from a file 
and the constrained Delaunay triangulation is build. 
When clicking left, a point is input and the connected component containing
this point is shown.
You can try several points. Click right to terminate.

constrained_plus
Enter constraints with the mouse. They may intersect.
Their arrangement is triangulated
