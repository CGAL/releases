--------------------------

Demo programs illustrating the use of the geometric object 
generators in CGAL. 

Segment_generator_prog1.C
   illustrates the generic segment generator

Segemnt_generator_prog2.C
   generates a regular segment pattern

Triangle_generator_prog1.C
   generates random triangles

Triangle_generator_prog2.C
   generates a regular triangle pattern

generators_prog1.C
   generates 1000 points: 60% are drawn at random from a disc, 20% are drawn 
   from a square grid, 10% ae duplicate points and 10% are collinear points.

generators_prog2.C
   generates 500 points with integer coordinates

random_poly_manual_demo.C
   program presented in reference manual that generates a random 
   polygon from 50 points drawn at random from a square

random_polygons_demo.C
   more involved program that allows user input to supply the points
   from which random polygons are generated

rcs_demo.C
   generates a random convex set from n points, where n is specified by the
   user on the command line.
   
rcs_manual_demo.C
   program presetned in the manual that generates a random convex 500-gon
   from points drawn randomly from a square.
