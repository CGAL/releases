There following programs are availalbe here to illustrate some of the 2D
convex hull functions available in CGAL:

convex_hull_of_ipoints
    Generates 30 random segments with coordinates in the range
    (-256, 256) and computes the intersections of these segments
    The segments and their intersections are displayed in the window
    after the user clicks the mouse in the window. It then computes 
    the convex hull of the intersection points and displays this
    in the window.  The program exits after the user clicks once more
    in the window.

ch_of_polyline
    Computes the convex hull of a polyline whose vertices are read from
    standard input (cin) and displays the result in a window.  One example
    set of input is in the file ch_of_polyline.cin.  This program uses
    Melkman's algorithm.  If the program is compiled with the option
    NO_DISPLAY, the output is written to a PostScript file instead of a 
    window.
   
convex_hull_2_demo
    Computes the convex hull of a set of points whose vertices are read
    from standard input and displays the result in a window.
