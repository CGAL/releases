The directory contains 6 graphic demo programs.
To run them you need CGAL with LEDA.

Segment_arr_from_file - constructs a segment arrangement from an input
       file, some example files are given in segment_input_files/ .
       
Segment_arr_from_mouse - constructs a segment arrangement from window 
       input (uses the LEDA traits).

Circle_arr_from_file - constructs a circle arrangement from an input
       file, some example files are given in circle_input_files/ .

Polyline_arr_from_file - constructs a polyline arrangement from an input
       file, some example files are given in polyline_input_files/.

Polyline_arr_from_mouse - constructs a polyline arrangement from window
       input. It Does not use the LEDA traits (but, of course, the LEDA
       graphic interface).

Seg_circ_arr_from_file - constructs an arrangement of circular arcs and 
       line segments from an input file. Some example files are given in 
       seg_circ_input_files/.

Polygon_intersection_demo - demonstrates using the arrangement to
       compute the intersection of the interiors of polygons. The demo program
       is separated from the algorithm itself so it can be easily used in 
       other programs.
