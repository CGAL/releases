Test with exact arithmetic:
==================================================
  ovl_homo_double.C          ... simple test program with output in a file
  ovl_homo_gmpz.C            ... simple test program with output in a file

Tool for graphically displaying the planar maps:
================================================
  ShowPlanarMaps.java	     ... Java application that displays both the initial
				 maps and their overlay, colored
Misc:
=====
  1,2,...		     ... directories containing input data
  makefile                   ... according makefile
  compile		     ... script that compiles C and Java programs


Instructions for use
====================

1. You can create your own input data sets. For this, you have to 
   make a directory in which you put two files, with information
   describing two planar maps. For the sake of simplicity, these 
   files will have the format required by the Java application:
   - pm-1.in, 
   - pm-2.in:
	nr_vertices
          x_vertex_0 y_vertex_0
          x_vertex_1 y_vertex_1

	  ...
	nr_edges
          index_vertex_1 index_vertex_2 color
	  ...
   where
 	nr_vertices 	is the number of vertices in the planar map;
	x_vertex_i, y_vertex_i is the pair of coordinates of the 
	  		i'th vertex
	nr_edges 	is the number of edges in the planar map;
	index_vertex_1 index_vertex_2 is the pair of vertices
			of this edge, given as their indices in 
			the array of vertices 
	color 		is the color (1 for pm-1, 2 for pm-2).

2. Compile both the C programs and the Java application 
   with 
	compile

3. Run any of the C programs; you will be asked to input the 
   directory containing the input data.
     If these programs run successfuly, in that directory will
   be written the file pm.out, containing a description of the
   overlay.
     It is recommended that you process data from each directory.

4. Run the Java application:
    	java ShowPlanarMaps
   Use the Choice at the top of the window to select the 
   map to be displayed.
