There are four demos. To activate them just run : demo{index}
for example : demo1

In the leda window you will see three types of objects:

1. Input segments - in black.
2. Iterated Snap Rounding output objects - in red.
3. Hot pixels - in green.

It may take a while to show the output.

You can also create demos of your own. In order to do it, you first should
create an input file. The input file is in the following form: first
the number of input segments and then a for each segment a quadruple
representing its two endpoints. The first two numbers of the quadruple
are the x and y values of the first endpoint respectively and than
the x and y values of the second endpoint respectively. The following is an example
of an input file of four segments.

4
0.7 0.5 10.7 10.7
0.7 10.5 10.5 0.5
10.7 2.5 0.7 2.5
10.7 7.5 0.7 7.5

After you finish writing the input file you run the demo. The syntax is:

demo <precision> <input file name> [do_isr = t][wait for a click = f]

The first parameter determines the precision of the Iterated Snap Rounding.
The third parameter determines whether to do a regular Snap Rounding
or an Iterated Snap Rounding.
The fourth parameter determines if the user should press a button
before he sees the output.
