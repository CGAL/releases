viewpoint2off.C

    A demo program that converts geometry files in Viewpoint
    Data Labs mesh format into OFF files. Type 'make viewpoint2off'
    to compile it. See http://www.viewpoint.com/

    It is in the demo directory since no viewpoint example 
    data is provided and for the moment it will not run with
    the SunPro 4.2 CC compiler (a mysterious error claiming
    that const CGAL_Point_3<CGAL_Cartesian<float>> is incomplete).

geomview.C

    Displays a polyhedron from CGAL in Geomview using
    CGAL_Geomview_stream. Type 'make geomview' to compile it.
