CGAL KD-Tree demo
--------------------

  This directory contains the kd-tree demo. To compile you will need LEDA
compiled with redefined names (to avoid name conflicts with Cgal).
  To compile the demo program, enter the  directory. Update the
makefile , and do make. This will produce several demo programs
kdtest_2, kdtest_3, kdtest_4, kdtest_10, kdtest_20, kdtest_30 (the
same demo program in various dimensions).
  The program randomly chooses a set of points and a query rectangle
and colors all  the points in the query rectangle . In the higher
dimensions the display shows the projections of the points and the
rectangle for every pair of axes.
  The program can run without the rest of Cgal.
