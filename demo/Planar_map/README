Planar Map Package Demo Program
-------------------------------

  The directory contains a demo program (do "make demo" to compile)
and a utility program for generating input files for the demo program 
(do "make helputil" to compile).
  There is also a directory "input_files" which contains some input
files in the format needed for the demo program.

The demo program:
-----------------

  The demo program can be run with a file in the format defined below,
or it can be run without arguments in which case the user builds a planar
map interactively using the mouse. 
  The left button starts a new vertex and pressing it repeatedly will 
insert an edge from the last vertex inserted. The right button will start 
from the nearest existing vertex and will end a session of left-button presses
with an edge to the nearest vertex.

After the planar map is read (from the file or interactively) the user can use
the mouse for queries (ray shooting and point location).

usage: 
	demo [filename]  
 

The helputil program :
-------------------
The program handles input files for the demo program .
The Input file should be at the following format:
       <n = number of points>
       <x1> <y1> 
       ...
       <xn> <yn>
       <k = number of curves>
       <s1> <t1>
       ...
       <sk> <tk>
  Where xi, yi are the coordinates of point i and si,ti
are the indices (in the the above list of points) 
of the source and the target of curve i.

  The utilities given are creating a random file of (possibly
intersecting) segments, and intersection of such a file into
a file of non-intersecting segments.

Usages:

1. Intersect Line Segments:
	helputil  i <input_file> <output_file>
       	

2. Create random (not intersected) file with <num> segments:
	helputil  r <num> <output_file>
