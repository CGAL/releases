demo:
Illustrates features of the  basic triangulation and of Delaunay Triangulation
(i. e. the classes CGAL_Triangulation_2<Gt,Tds> and
CGAL_Delaunay_triangulation_2<Gt,Tds>)
It makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA to be installed.


More demos about Constrained and Regular triangulation 
will be provided soon.
