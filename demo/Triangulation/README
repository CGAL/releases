lfc (line face circulator)
Illustrates walking in a triangulation
It makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA to be installed.


demo:
Illustrates features of the triangulation package.
It makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA to be installed.


crust:
Computes the crust of a set of points
It makes use of graphical IO and needs LEDA to be installed.


points3D:
Illustrates how tu use 3D points with the 2D triangulation class.
It does not make use of graphical IO,  rather you can view the
resulting file using any inventor viewer (like Cosmo, ivview, etc.)
