------- demo -------------------------------------------------
(this is an elementary demo, a nice one should come in the future)

Construction of a Delaunay triangulation.

Needs an input file "data/points" containing points (given by x y z)

Opens a geomview window
[see the chapter Geomview in the cgal manual - support library:
Important: The last line in the startup file .geomview must be (echo
"started"). The two commands rsh and Geomview must be in the user's
path, otherwise the program will not be able to execute.]

Draws the triangulation (vertices and edges) in geomview

Locates a point a shows the cell containing it

Draws the triangulation (vertices, edges and cells) in geomview

Writes the triangulation into a file "data/output"

This demo program uses "doubles". 
For a robust version, another arithmetic should be used.
