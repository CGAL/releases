---------------------------

Interactive demo programs of some optimisation algorithms in CGAL.
Input (mouse clicks) and output are visualized in a LEDA window.

The provided makefile is prepared to link with LEDA.


all_furthest_neighbors_2_demo: 

generates a random convex polygon (with 30 vertices) and computes for
all vertices the furthest neighbor. If the left mouse button is
clicked near a vertex, the corresponding furthest neighbor is marked
with a little circle. Quit by clicking the middle or right mouse
button.

extremal_polygon_2_demo:

compute the largest area or perimeter k-gon that can be inscribed into
a convex polygon. Vertices can be added with the left, moved with the
middle and deleted with the right mouse button. There is a button to
generate random convex polygons and a slider to change k and n (the
number of vertices to generate).

rectangular_p_center_2_demo:

compute the rectangular p-centers of a set S of n points in the plane,
i.e. cover S with p congruent axis-parallel squares of minimal
size. Add points by clicking the left mouse button; clicking the
middle mouse button or "Compute" calculates and displays the result.
The buttons "Square" and "Disc" generate random points drawn uniformly
from the unit square and disc, resp. The parameters n and p can be
adjusted through the corresponding widgets. "Cluster" generates p
random clusters of size "Cluster Size"; "Clear" removes all points
from the input set S. Finally, with "PS" and "ASCII" one can get a
postscript and ASCII, resp., output of the scene onto stdout.
