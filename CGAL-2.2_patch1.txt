Patch 1 for CGAL-2.2.

Fixes
-----

Min_quadrilateral_2
   The demo program failed to check if enough points were on the convex hull
   before computing the minimum enclosing object.

Regular 2D triangulations:
   Due to a missing typedef, the weights were not taken into account and as 
   a result, the regular triangulation was correct but it was just a Delaunay 
   triangulation.

Sphere_3
   The file include/CGAL/Sphere_3.h and files depending on it were accidentally 
   omitted from the release.
