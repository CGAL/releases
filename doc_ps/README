install.ps contains the installation guide.

The reference manual is split in three files, numbered 1, 2 and 3.
No 1 describes the kernel: basic data types like points, lines, triangles etc.
No 2 describes the besic library: algorithms to compute e.g. convec hulls,
intersection of polygons, triangulations etcetera.
No 3 describes non-geometric stuff.

get-started.ps is a tutorial style document. It is a good starting point.

use-stl.ps contains some information about programming with the help of the
Standard Template Library. Some familiarity with this library is helpful when
using CGAL.
