This directory contains test suites for the geometric classes of 
the CGAL Kernel. The makefile allows to specify 
 o if the testing is done for cartesian or homogeneous repesentation,
 o the numbertype.

The files cover all operations that can be performed on geometric
objects and the code is splattered with assertions, to perform
the correctness tests.
