\chapter{Iso-oriented Objects}\label{IsoObjects}

In many applications the objects are iso-oriented, which means that their
sides are parallel to the axes of the coordinate system. These objects
have not only a more compact description, but there are many algorithms
which are faster for iso-oriented objects. 

At the moment \cgal\ only has the following class, more classes 
will be integrated in the future.
