\chapter{3D Point, Vector and Direction \label{PointVectorDirection3}}


We already explained in the section of two dimensional objects why we
distinguish between points, vectors and directions. This chapter will
only give the functions that can be applied on such objects.

\section{Conversion between Points and Vectors\label{conversion3d}}

As in the two dimensional case you subtract a point $p$ from the 
symbolic constant \CCstyle{CGAL_ORIGIN} to obtain the locus vector of $p$.

In order to obtain the point corresponding to a vector $v$ you simply
have to add $v$ to \CCstyle{CGAL_ORIGIN}.


See Section~\ref{conversion} for an example.
