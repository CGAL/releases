The files in this directory can be used to generate the 
CGAL kernel code. In order to do so you should install
symbolic links as follows:

ln -s  ../../include  ../include

ln -s  ../../src  ../src

ln -s  ../../Templates.DB  ../Templates.DB

and call funnelweb on kernel.fw.

The links ensure that files are written at the correct
place.
