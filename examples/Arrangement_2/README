In this directory there are 8 example program for the arrangement package.

example1-5 : The example programs from the documentation.

example6   : Demonstrates the use of the cached traits and the walk point
location strategy.
  This example creates an arrangement with a walk point location
  with the cached info traits class. You can see the difference between
  the regular exact traits and the cached traits by replacing the relevant 
  lines with the commented lines.
  NOTE: if you want to run this example with different numbers
  (even slightly larger numbers), use a
  multiple precision integer (e.g., gmpz or leda_integer). Otherwise there
  will be an overflow and the program will go into an infinite loop.

example7   : Demonstrates the use of update mode, and how to add info to
the objects of the class.

example8   : Reads an arrangement of segments from standard input and
performs a vertical ray shoot on it.

example9-10: Examples from the documentation. These demonstrate using
an arrangement with Polyline Traits.
