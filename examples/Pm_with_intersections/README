In this directory there are 2 example programs for the Planar Map with
Intersections package.

Note: As the Planar Map with Intersection package enhances the Planar Map
package, all example programs of the latter except for example7 and example8 
serve as example programs for Planar Msp with Intersection.


example1 : Demonstrates the simplest use of the package, insertion of 
           intersecting curves.

example2 : Deomnstrates a user defined notifier.

example3 : Demonstraits insertion of non intersecting curves. The insertion
           is carried out through the Planar_map_2 corresponding
	   insert functions. 

example4 : Demonstrates aggregate insertion of intersecting curves.
