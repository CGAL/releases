In this directory there are 5 example programs for the Sweep Line package.

example1: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          construct a planar map of line segments.
          See comment at the end regarding graphical interface.
 
example2: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          construct a planar map of polylines.
          See comment at the end regarding graphical interface.     

example3: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior sub-segments.
 
example4: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior polyline sub-segments.

example5: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm in order to
          produce a collection of all intersection points of the
          given segments in the input.

Comment regarding graphical interface
If you want to visualize the results of example1 and example2, uncomment
the relevant lines in the source (#include directives and window related
statements). You also need to link against the cgal_window library. This
can be done by using a makefile that was generated with 
`create_makefile -w'. Make sure you have a cgal window library installed.
Consult with the installation manual if you are not sure.
