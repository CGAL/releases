In this directory there are 5 example programs for the Sweep Line package.

example1: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior sub-segments.
 
example2: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm to
          produce a collection of disjoint interior polyline sub-segments.

example3: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm to get
	  a list of all intersection points between the specified curves.

example4: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm to determine
	  whether any two curves in the given range intersect.

example5: Demonstate the use of the sweep line algorithm to get the list
	  of intersection points with references to the original curves.
