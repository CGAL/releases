This directory contains 5 example programs for Topological Maps.

In example1 a simple Topological_map is constructed.

In example2 a Topological_map with additional information in the faces is
constructed.

A construction of a Topological_map with integer names for vertices and
curves is demonstrated in example3.

In example4 a Topological_map with 2 dimensional points is constructed.
 
The last example, example5, shows how to apply various operations on edges
of a Topological_map (e.i., insertion, splitting, merging, and removal).
