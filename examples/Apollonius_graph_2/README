This is the examples directory for the Apollonius_graph_2 package
There are 4 example programs in this directory. Each one of these is
aimed at describing a different usage for the Apollonius_graph_2
package. In particular:

* example1.C: a very basic example. It uses the Filtered_exact number
  type to achieve robustness.

* example2.C: it shows how to change the method the predicates are
  evaluated. By default the predicates use only the operations +,-,*
  and these are the only operations that is assumed they are exact. In
  this example we show how to change that and how to define the traits
  class so that the operations +,-,*,/,sqrt are used and are assumed
  exact. Again Filtered_exact is used as the number type.

* example3.C: a variation of the first example. A filtered kernel is
  now used instead of the Filtered_exact number type. We also show how
  to use another parameter for the algorithm, namely the one that
  indicates whether hidden weighted points are to be stored or not.

* example4.C: same as the previous example except the fact that now we
  store the hidden weighted points and on top of that we use an
  hierarchy of Apollonius graphs.
